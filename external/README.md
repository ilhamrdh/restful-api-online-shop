# External Folder

This folder is designated to store files and scripts related to third-party integrations or external dependencies.

-   Place all third-party dependencies, including libraries, SDKs, and configuration files, in this folder.
-   Maintain clear documentation on the purpose and usage of each third-party component.
-   Include any licenses or legal documentation associated with the third-party assets stored in this folder.
-   Regularly update external dependencies to the latest versions to ensure compatibility and security.

## Usage

1. **Dependency Management**: Store any external libraries or SDKs required for the project within this folder.
2. **Configuration Files**: Keep configuration files provided by third-party services or APIs here.
3. **Legal Compliance**: Include licenses and legal documentation for third-party assets to ensure compliance with usage rights.
